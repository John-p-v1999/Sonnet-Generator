# Sonnet-Generator
step1: download the 

          1. templates folder
          2. tokenizer.pickle files
          3. app.py 
          4. trained_weigts file  
          
  All of these files should be downloaded to a single directory

step 2:ENVIRONMENT SETUP

          1. tensorflow 
          2. pickle
          3. numpy
          4. flask
          These libraries are necessary to just run the UI, ie to just get the output
          
step 3: run the app.py file. Note: the templates folder and the rest of the files mentioned in step 1 should be in the same directory as app.py. If not changes will need to be made to the app.py file.

step 4: the UI will be run on localhost. Enter a starting word and set temperature value. temperature value manipulation results in different sonnets which contain different randomness in selection of words.

step 5: modelling code will be available in model.ipynb. Open it in google colab and load the dataset. The rest of the code only needs to be run
